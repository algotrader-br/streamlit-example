    ## Introduction

    On this page you can find the results of my daily trades in
    **real account**! The idea is that the update is almost *real-time*.

    Currently my **algo trading** systems are specialized in *day trade* for the brazilian mini-index
    (**WINFUT**), where trades are executed **100% automated** using MetaTrader 5.

   ðŸ‘ˆ Select the page on the side to get the information you want.
    Be it **performance** information (backtest and/or real live trading), **trade statistics** (e.g. profit/loss),
    and also the breakdown of **backtest and real account differences**.

    ### Contact

    - Questions and suggestions, please contact me by email: algotraderbr@gmail.com
